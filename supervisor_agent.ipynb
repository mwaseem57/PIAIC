            "**1. App Idea & Purpose:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **What problem does your app solve?**  What is the core purpose of your app? What need does it fulfill?\n",
            "*   **Target Audience:** Who are you building this app for?  (e.g., students, fitness enthusiasts, businesses, gamers, etc.)  Knowing your audience will influence design and features.\n",
            "*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What makes your app different or better than existing apps in the same category?  Why would someone choose your app over the competition?\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Features & Functionality:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Core Features:** What are the MUST-HAVE features that are essential for your app to function?\n",
            "*   **Secondary Features:** What are some \"nice-to-have\" features that would enhance the user experience but aren't strictly necessary for the core functionality?\n",
            "*   **List of specific functionalities:**  Think about things like:\n",
            "    *   User accounts (login, registration, profiles)\n",
            "    *   Data storage (local or cloud-based)\n",

            "    *   Location services (GPS)\n",
            "    *   Camera access\n",

            "    *   **Native:** Built specifically for a single platform (iOS or Android) using the platform's native languages (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). Offers the best performance and access to device features but requires separate codebases for each platform.\n",
            "    *   **Cross-Platform:**  Built using a single codebase that can be deployed to multiple platforms (iOS and Android).  Examples include:\n",
            "        *   **React Native:** Uses JavaScript and React to build native-like UIs.\n",
            "        *   **Flutter:** Uses Dart language and offers excellent performance and a rich set of widgets.\n",
            "        *   **Xamarin:** Uses C# and allows sharing a significant portion of code between platforms.\n",
            "        *   **Ionic/Cordova:** Uses web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create hybrid apps.\n",
            "*   **Backend (if needed):** Does your app require a backend server to store data, handle user authentication, or perform other server-side tasks?  If so, what technologies are you considering for the backend (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails, PHP, cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)?\n",
            "*   **Third-Party APIs & Services:** Will your app need to integrate with any third-party APIs (e.g., Google Maps, social media APIs, payment gateways)?\n",

            "**4. Design & User Interface (UI):**\n",

            "*   **General Style:** What kind of look and feel are you aiming for? (e.g., minimalist, modern, playful, professional)\n",

            "*   **User Experience (UX):** How do you want users to interact with your app?  Consider the flow of actions and the overall usability.  Sketching out wireframes (basic screen layouts) can be very helpful at this stage.\n",

            "\n",

            "**6. Development Team:**\n",

            "*   **Will you be hiring a freelance developer or agency?**\n",
